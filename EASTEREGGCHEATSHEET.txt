Easter Egg Summary - just some fun code to mess around with when I felt burnt out, I hope you try to find all 4 Easter Eggs BEFORE referring to the cheat sheet! Regardless, enjoy, it was a way of expressing myself through the code and having fun with the project in its final stages!

ASCII Art in Source Code

Located in: footer.php

A block of detailed ASCII art, created using an online tool which I credited in the comments, has been embedded in the site’s HTML as a developer-facing Easter egg.

It is placed within an HTML comment near the bottom of the source, only visible to those inspecting the code via "View Page Source" or DevTools.

The Artwork is of "Craig Jones" a Jiu Jitsu Idol of mine from Australia, and somewhat of a comedian on the side! This was ultimately inspired by a website called "Lings Cars" where she built a car sales site using only basic HTML and CSS, however she threw in funny ASCII art of herself for curious 'inspect website' users! Shout out Lings Cars!!!!

Konami Code Trigger (JS Keyboard Easter Egg)

Implemented in: header.php

When users input the classic Konami Code using their keyboard (↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A), an animated GIF pops up temporarily on the page.

The trigger uses a keycode listener with a timed display of an image with a bit of a synth/retro wave aesthetic, I can't get enough of it.

This is a non-intrusive JavaScript-based feature intended as a surprise interaction, hope you enjoy!

We all like video games! Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter were a big part of my young life, this easter egg pays homage to that. The Cat represents how I have felt during my entire coding journey thus far! Haha!

Developer Console Easter Egg (Matrix + Jiu Jitsu Style)

Implemented in: footer.php

Upon opening the browser console, the user is presented with a styled sequence of console log messages:

“Wake up, user...”

“The Jiu Jitsu Vault has you...”

“Follow the white belt 🥋”

Paying homage to one of the greatest films ever made, The Matrix - it's what got me into Martial Arts as a kid. Hope you enjoy the message!

Hidden Easter Egg Page: /easteregg.php

A separate page accessible only by those who “follow the white belt.” (Another Matrix reference, but with a Jiu Jitsu twist)!

The link is subtly included at the bottom of every page via a nearly invisible <p> tag styled to blend into the background (footer.php). It will be to the right of the Komono Emoji!

The page features:

A hidden Matrix-themed visual layout (I wanted to flex my CSS muscles here a bit, I have been reading up on the HTML/CSS and JavaScript languages through Jon Ducketts books. Thanks Jon Duckett for the confidence boost!).

A floating Morpheous image (NEEEEOOO!!!)

A red pill and blue pill interaction:

Red Pill keeps the user on the page

Blue Pill returns them to the main list of techniques (list.php)

Ultimately this was my favourite part of the project, I hope you enjoy the little Easter Eggs I planted throughout the site - I'm hoping to show off my personality (Less professional side) and what I find interesting.
